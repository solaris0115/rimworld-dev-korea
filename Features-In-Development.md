Unless otherwise specified, the features documented on this page are available in the Development version of Humanoid Alien Races.

* Steam Workshop: [Humanoid Alien Races - Dev](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2640710953)
* GitHub: [Dev Branch](https://github.com/solaris0115/rimworld-dev-korea/tree/Dev)

You should not run the Dev version and the Live version of HAR at the same time. Note that the Dev version of HAR will not be recognized as being the same as the live version as it is under a different packageId and cause mods that depend on HAR to report it as a missing dependency; this is normal and will not affect its functionality.

Feedback and test of features in development is greatly appreciated. Please use the [Humanoid Alien Races Discord server](http://discord.gg/XMCRj46) for providing feedback, comments, or questions about the Dev build!
